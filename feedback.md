__Areas of Strength:__   
You did a fantastic job presenting your project, starting with a strong introduction that immediately grabbed attention. I really liked that you picked a fresh dataset that most people didn’t choose, it showed creativity and courage to go against the norm. Even with limited data, you explored the potential trends and possibilities thoroughly, which is exactly the kind of thinking that matters in real-world scenarios. You explained the tools and process clearly, including how you used Python to clean the data and automate updates, and how the dashboard could help different brands make business decisions. Your analysis was detailed and insightful, from highlighting branch profits, customer behaviour, and payment methods, to exploring subscription services, restocking predictions, and even mapping branch activity for emergencies. Your passion, creativity, and clear understanding of the client’s perspective really stood out, and your presentation demonstrated a lot of hard work and attention to detail.

__Areas for Development:__  
For the dashboard visuals, you might consider using a slightly softer color palette, just to make the key information stand out even more and make it easier for the audience to absorb at a glance. While your analysis was very detailed, focusing on the highest-priority insights and trends will make your key points even more impactful. Overall, with a bit of fine-tuning in pacing and prioritisation, this project has the potential to be truly outstanding.

__Scores:__  
Technical Ability Score: 3/4		
Behaviour, Attitude and Mindset Score: 3/4

__Focus points moving forward:__  
For my next project (HR Analytics), I will have a stronger palette with high contrast (this is brand dependent) and use cleaner visual lines to relieve cognitive load. Make the presentation more pointed.
